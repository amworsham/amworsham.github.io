		I discovered user experience design at the beginning of 2017 and knew immediately that this is what I wanted to do for a living. I enjoy creating great experiences for people. I love researching people and watching all of the different ways that their brain wants to use this app or site. I enjoy amking experiences easier and more pleasurable for people. It's my own way of making the world a better place to navigate and be apart of.
