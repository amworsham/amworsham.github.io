		Your health and your happiness should be your top priorities in life. For me, one thing that achieves both of these priorities is weight lifting. I have a passion for health, wellness, fitness, and living a balanced life. I have a blog where I share tips and how eating a flexible diet, weight training, and HIIT can make you strong, healthy, and confident.
