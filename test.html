			<h1>Ashley Worsham</h1>
			<h2>San Francisco, California</h2>

				<p>I was born and raised in Monterey, Califonia. I graduated from Santa Clara Univeristy last year with a degree in psychology and german studies. I just graduated from Hult International Business School with an MIB (Master of International Business) and I'm currently working for two startups part time as a UX designer and researcher. I also love to hike, explore the city, and travel.</p>
				

				<p>The reason I'm taking this class is because I think it will help me understand the developing process and make me a better UX designer overall. I will be able to communicate more effectively with developers, be more realistic and efficient with design needs, and I think it will help my job opportunities later on. It's also pretty fascinating and a good feeling when these tags actually work and you can create something like this on your own.</p>
